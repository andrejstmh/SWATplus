Fast changes of SWATPLUS

Sometimes we need to quickly improve the code without waiting for the office version to be released. I hope the project will help to achieve this purpose!

Compilation: https://swatplus.gitbook.io/docs/source-code

## Results SWAT+ original executable (60.5.2) vs compiled one.
There are some differences in the results files (release):channel_sd_day.txt,channel_sdmorph_day.txt, hydin_mon.txt, hydin_yr.txt, hydout_mon.txt, hydout_yr.txt, reservoir_day.txt, ru_aa.txt, ru_mon.txt, ru_yr.txt. Probably all differences connected with averaging errors. Few (<10) numbers per file in the >6th significant digit.
